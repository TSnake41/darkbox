Darkbox standalone module to use Console Input.
This, of course does not need darkbox to work, it work as a standalone.

Syntax :
  darkbox_i [-k[_] OR [-m] OR [-y] OR [-h]

  -k: Return keyboard key to errorlevel
  -m: Return mouse clic to stdout (see "Mouse event format")
  -y: Return any mouse movement to stdout (see "Mouse event format")
  -h: Return a non-nul positive value if data is available in stdin.

NOTE: darkbox_i support both darkbox ('-') and batbox ('/') command prefixes.

Mouse event format: "x y c"
  - x: X position of the mouse in the console
  - y: Y position of the mouse in the console
  - c: mouse event value (like mouse button or simply movement)

IMPORTANT:
  As darkbox now uses batbox keycodes, the errorlevel could excess 255 which
  can be broken on platforms that does not support exit codes beyond 255.
  (e.g Linux), therfore, you shouldn't use darkbox_i to handle such keys and
  instead use darkbox which support these keys regardless of platform-specific
  limits.
