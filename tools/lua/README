Here you have my own tiny lua distribution (for Windows and Linux).
Have fun with it !

Use it, hack it, distribute it with your project the only thing I want to help
you to make funny things, to make projects that grow. So, I share you this
distribution of Lua, because I am not the only one that need it, you probably
(or will) need it too. And you should too, share your work, your knowledges with
others, to do the same.

I do not ask you to throw your project into the ground, just make it Open Source
with a raisonable licence.

Never forget that, share permit knowledge. Knowledge allows us to share new knowledge.

Quotes from lua.org :
« Just download it and use it. »
« The spirit of the Lua license is that you are free to use Lua for any purpose
  at no cost without having to ask us. The only requirement is that if you do use
  Lua, then you should give us credit by including the copyright notice somewhere
  in your product or its documentation. A nice, but optional, way to give us further
  credit is to include a Lua logo and a link to our site in a web page for your product.

PS: I do not own lua, but I share it because I like it and peoples do not use it
    not because this is bad, but just because they do not know that exists.

PS2: In the future, I will make a lua version with stuff present in the "lib/"
     directory, so, you will be able to do powerful portable terminal games in Lua.
     Something like an ultimate lua version for terminal-based games.

NOTE: If you do not have any binary of lua, no worry, you are using git version,
      so just take it in the latest offical release.

NOTE2:
    - Linux version is built using clang with musl-libc, everything is "static",
      so it should even work on a barebones Linux kernel.
    - Window version is built using latest tcc.
